# ChatGPT Telegram Bot

This is a Telegram chat bot built using the ChatGPT (aka GPT-3.5) language model from OpenAI.

## Personal chats

The bot acts as your personal assistant:

To allow other users to use the bot, list them in the `telegram_usernames` config property.

Something, it's easier to edit your previous message instead of copy and paste. This bot works as you expected. When you finish your editing, bot will answer on new version of your message.

The bot has a terrible memory, so don't expect it to remember any chat context by default. But you can ask follow-up questions using a plus sign:

<table>
    <tr>
        <td>
            <img src="docs/chat-2.png" alt="Question" width="400">
        </td>
        <td>
            <img src="docs/chat-3.png" alt="Follow-up question" width="400">
        </td>
    </tr>
</table>


Available commands:

-   `/retry` - retry answering the last question
-   `/help` - show help

## Groups

To get an answer from the bot in a group, mention it in a reply to a question, or ask a question directly:

<table>
    <tr>
        <td>
            <img src="docs/chat-4.png" alt="Reply with mention" width="400">
        </td>
        <td>
            <img src="docs/chat-5.png" alt="Direct question" width="400">
        </td>
    </tr>
</table>

To make the bot reply to group members, list the group id in the `telegram_chat_ids` config property. Otherwise, the bot will ignore questions from group members unless they are listed in the `telegram_usernames` config property.

## Setup

1. Get your [OpenAI API](https://openai.com/api/) key

2. Get your Telegram bot token from [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather)

3. Copy `config.example.yml` to `config.yml` and specify your tokens there.

4. Start the bot:

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

Based on the [chatgpt_telegram_bot](https://github.com/karfly/chatgpt_telegram_bot). I removed all the bells and whistles, refactored the code and added comments.
